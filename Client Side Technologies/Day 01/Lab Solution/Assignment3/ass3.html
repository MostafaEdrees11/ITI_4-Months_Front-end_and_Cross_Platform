My dog Sasha is my best friend She like to chase the soccer ball
when I practice. It is so funny to see her running down the field
trying to catch the ball with her mouth. It just won't fit!

<p>
Once Sasha saved my life. When I was only 4 years old. I started
to go into the street to get a ball that has rolled across the street. <br>
Of course I did not think to look for cars! Sasha got in front of me and
knocked me backwards onto the sidewalk. <br> I was mad until I saw the car go by
where I would have been. Then I was so happy that Sasha was smarter that I was!
